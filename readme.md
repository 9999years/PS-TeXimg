PS-TeXimg is a PowerShell module that exports a cmdlet `TeXimg` which renders
LaTeX equation and saves them as images / copies them to the clipboard.

I had a really neat version working with documentation and everything but then I
accidentally deleted all the code when I was trying to generate a module
manifest, so Iâ€™m starting over again.
